**Color for your text**

Markdown does not support color.  However, HTML does.  Additionally, Github strips out certain HTML elements for security purposes, and therefore does not support color elements.  For Jupyter Files, Markdown does support color when displayed in .ipynb files, and you can consider to add in color elements:
> `<span style="color:blue"> This text is blue, using HTML elements </span>`
---
**Code Blocks**

You can establish a code block with the tilted apostrophe symbols, above the tab key on your keyboard: 
> `Here is an example of a code block`
---
**Quote Blocks**

You can indent your paragraphs or specific quotes using the `>` operator:
> This is an indented quote block for formatting text. 
---
**External URLs**

You can set external URLs with the `[Text to describe URL](URL website goes here)`
> [Here is a URL that is hyperlinked](www.google.com)
---
<!--**Internal URLs**-
--- -->
**Bullet Points**

You can define a bullet point either with the - or the * symbols, spaced out from the text.
> - This is the first bullet point in this sequence.
> - Here is the second bullet point in the sequence.

As an alternative, you can create lists within lists, or nested bullet points.

* Here is our first bullet point in the second list. 
  * After typing **2 spaces** before this second bullet point, we have created a nested list.
    * This process can continue on several layers, if you so choose.
    * Lists can use *, -, +, or 1., or 2)

**Emojis (the new emoticon)**

Emojis display emoticons (text-based images), in a graphical display, as found in messaging softwares both in Enterprise and consumer solutions.

_Some examples follow:_
`:bar_chart:` :bar_chart:
`:thumbsup:` :thumbsup:
`:books:` :books:
`:smile:` :smile:
`:sweat:` :sweat:
`:smiling_imp:` :smiling_imp:

You can view a comprehensive list on the [emoji cheatsheet](https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/).
